# sixlinesaddress

Token that returns the name and address of a contact leaving no blank lines.

The default format is:

- prefix first name last name
- suppl. address 1
- suppl. address 2
- street
- postal code city
- country

If any of these lines are not filled in, a br will be added at the end.
Hence, always returning 6 lines.
